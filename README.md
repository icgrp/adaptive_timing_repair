# Adaptive Timing Repair 

## This is an extension of adaptive timing repair done on the 7-series FPGA. This extension work, investigates Adaptive Timing Repair on the ULTRAScale+ 

# Modifications: 1.  Adding a time series algorithm to track changes in profile to allow for prediction and preemptive repair. 
#                2.  Use CPU on the ULTRASCALE+ SoC to control repair without user intervention.
